#Bus Booking System
This is a Bus reservation program made by Ashwani Kumar pal as an end semester project.

The Project contains:
1) A Home screen where user identifies himself as an operator or a passenger.
2) A Passengers screen where user can enter source and destination to find Buses.
3) A Bus booking window where the user can book the bus of his choice
4) An Operator portal for Bus owners to register their buses on different routes.

The database contains two tables:
1) Buses - This is where available buses are stores with relevant information
2) Passengers - This table contains the name and Unique reference id of registered passengers.

Some Buses are already there in the database on the following routes:
1) Kanpur - Guna
2) Kanpur - Ambala
